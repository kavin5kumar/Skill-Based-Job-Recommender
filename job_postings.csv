Software Quality Engineer,"Sephora, a division of LVMH - Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton global luxury leader, is a global leader in beauty retailing. It successfully operates more than three thousand points of sale across Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Asia. Its aim is to animate the most loved beauty community in the world.

Sephora South East Asia is a high growth division of leading global beauty retailer, Sephora. Our teams run omnichannel retail businesses in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong; Franchise operations in India & Indonesia; and ecommerce-only business (the first in the world globally for Sephora!) in the Philippines. We have recently opened new markets in Hong Kong and New Zealand as well!

Our success is built on innovation, a unique product portfolio, market-leading digital capabilities, and our exceptional people! With ambitious growth plans, we are always looking for talented people who are passionate about building businesses and developing themselves and our customers' experience.

At Sephora, we stand together, and we stand for something more. Every day we reimagine beauty, discover new brands, and influence positive change. Data plays a big role in that. You make it possible for us to extend our reach beyond our existing markets in Asia & Oceania, and to deliver the customer experience to fans in countries awaiting our arrival. You will be working closely with team members distributed across multiple geographic locations in Singapore, Korea, and India.

Sephora SEA’s retail activity spans over 16 countries (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, India, Indonesia with others) with 100+ stores and boasts some global flagships such as Ion in Singapore and Pitt Street in Sydney. Its e-commerce activities span over eight countries (retail countries mentioned above excluding India, plus Philippines).

Sephora Digital’s Technology team builds products that power our business across South East Asia & Oceania. We are looking for a Junior Software Engineer to join our “Purchase Intent” squad, the team responsible for building products and features around Product pages, Carts, Promotions, Sales and Discounts for our website & apps. This is a key position in the team as we increase our capacity to deliver an ambitious roadmap.

You make it possible for us to deliver an engaging and seamless customer experience to our many fans across 9 countries, and ensure that the online store remains our flagship in South East Asia. Reporting to an Engineering Manager, you will work on high impact products which directly impact our revenue and customer satisfaction - two of our key metrics for success. This is a great platform for an ambitious engineer with excellent technical skills to start a career with Sephora, the leading omni-channel retailer in South East Asia.





We work with Ruby on Rails / Vue js and write tests on a daily basis. Experience with these technologies and tools are desired but not an absolute requirement.

You probably have a computer science degree or relevant work-experience as a software engineer, but passion and demonstrated expertise are what we care about.

Software Quality Engineer,"Rupifi is seeking an exceptional Software Engineer (Backend) to join the early team and help modernise the B2B payments industry.

We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll visit our customers, and come to understand their mission and their pain points."
Software Quality Engineer,"Why Deliveroo?

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.

We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes.

And we're just getting started.

The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.

We are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.







We want to emphasise that we don’t expect you to meet all of the below but would love you to have experience in some of these areas.





We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.



We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around."

Software Quality Engineer,"Description

About us

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.

We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.

Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.



It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint-hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less, and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEART (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild



We are looking for a Full Stack Developer to produce scalable software solutions. You’ll be part of a cross-functional team that’s responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.

As a Full Stack Developer, you should be comfortable around both front-end and back-end coding languages, development frameworks, and third-party libraries. You should also be a team player with a knack for visual design and utility.

If you’re also familiar with Agile methodologies, we’d like to meet you.



It is a challenging and diverse role that requires you to improve the existing developer platform, with a constant focus on making the experience better and more feature-packed. While trying to find solutions to problems, which are often overlooked or just too complicated for people to think about solving. Join this role if you are someone who doesn't shy away from creating a path in uncharted territory and is comfortable with trying, failing, and course-correcting fast."

Software Quality Engineer,"About Glean

We're on a mission to bring people the knowledge they need to make a difference in the world.

Glean was founded by a seasoned team of former Google search and Facebook engineers, who wondered why we don't have an easier way of finding what we need at work. In our personal lives, we have tools to help us find pretty much whatever we need. Why don't we have that at work? And that was the beginning of Glean.

Glean searches across all your company's apps to help you find exactly what you need and discover the things you should know. We're a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same.

We're backed by some of the Valley's leading venture capitalists—including Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, and General Catalyst—and have assembled a world-class team with senior leadership experience at Google, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Rubrik, Uber, Intercom, Pinterest, Palantir, and others.



Glean is looking for Backend/Infrastructure engineers to build a highly performant, scalable, secure, permissions-aware system that makes all the relevant enterprise knowledge readily available to employees in all contexts of their work. The role provides ample opportunities to work on various aspects of building a modern cloud-native application stack using the latest best practices - examples of some technical challenges you can work on are building a scalable, reliable distributed system and underlying storage, a unified application framework and data model that makes it easy to index diverse sources of information, end-to-end aspects of security - application layer, platform layer as well as IT security, laser focus on making the experience feel instant, while at the same time balancing the system cost implications, and tooling for comprehensive monitoring and deployment of the system in multiple cloud environments.










We are a diverse bunch of people and we want to continue to attract and retain a diverse range of people into our organization. We're committed to an inclusive and diverse company. We do not discriminate based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race."

Cloud Engineer,"About Us

India’s economic infrastructure needs a complete overhaul. Today our digital economy rides on rickety monolithic systems built in the mid-90s. It takes months to do a simple bank integration and launch a fintech product. This inefficiency cannot continue.

If our economy has to grow, we need killer API infrastructure for financial services that rivals the likes of Stripe, and AWS.

At Setu, we are fixing this for good, by abstracting away the complexity of working with legacy financial infrastructure and replacing it with a developer platform that offers clean, high-performance API bundles to embed finance into any application.

So that developers can do what they do best, build amazing products that improve people’s lives.





As a part of DevOps, you will be the bridge between product engineering and infrastructure. Designing operations, automating them and ensuring smooth delivery, SLAs and security compliance will be among your chief responsibilities to shoulder. Your work will help developers function in a deterministic environment and deliver products seamlessly, thereby improving the entire organization’s quality of output and shortening time to market.

In short, constant learning and quick implementation to build uniform platforms and processes, while inherently maintaining security and compliance in the systems.





The DevOps role involves owning the responsibility of creating, building and ensuring the smooth operation of our infrastructure. Broadly, this translates to the following roles—



In this role, you’ll be working with the bel ow tech—

We don’t expect you to be a know-it-all but as long as you’re solid on the basics and have the drive to learn, we’ll ensure that you’re provided with all the resources and the environment to learn and grow.

Now you never have to wait at a bus stop ever again. Transport is fast becoming a fundamental need - like water or air. More people are travelling more and more every day. Yet, only around 15% of Indians can afford their own car, private taxi or a two-wheeler. The remaining 85% depend on public transport. Moreover, with growing traffic and congestion it’s becoming increasingly clear that private transport is causing more problems that it is solving; and a small but significant (and growing) segment are outright rejecting car ownership, even if they can afford it. At Chalo, our core purpose is to make travel better for everyone, and we believe that our cities, our health and our lives will be better when we improve the way we travel. We have begun our journey by focusing on bus travel - making it easier for those that rely on it, and also for those that are choosing it. Buses, as a mode of transport, form the core architecture of any city's transport system. They also offer the largest improvement areas and the largest opportunity to create an impact, with 2 out of 3 public transport users depending on buses for their travel.

Database Engineer,"OUR VISION: THE WORLD. SUBSCRIBED.

Customers have changed. They’re looking for new ways to engage with businesses. Consumers today have a new set of expectations. They want outcomes, not ownership. Customization, not generalization. Constant improvement, not planned obsolescence.

In the old world (let’s call it the Product Economy) it was all about things. Acquiring new customers, shipping commodities, billing for one-time transactions. But in today’s new era, it’s all about relationships. More and more customers are becoming subscribers because subscription experiences built around services meet consumers’ needs better than the static offerings or a single product.

Our vision is “The World Subscribed” where one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy® (a phrase coined by our CEO, Tien Tzuo and author of the best selling book Subscribed)


We are looking for a Database Engineer (DBE) to join a team of talented Engineers from prestigious companies such as Facebook, Groupon, Netflix, and Yahoo to name a few. This role will be a member of the Database Ops & Engineering group within Zuora’s Technical Operations (TechOps) organization, which supports and scales the Zuora service and underlying infrastructures. The DBE will be responsible for operating, automating of MySQL database instances across all environments.


As the performance of the database is critical to the response time of the application, and the Zuora service is business critical to every single one of its customers, this role is critical to the success of the business itself.

Database Engineer,"Why We Exist

The Indian internet has exploded. Over half a billion Indians will be online before the end of this year. Most of these Indians will prefer using their own language online. And next to nobody is building solutions for them. They are prevented from using the internet to its fullest potential because English forms a language barrier. Whenever they visit a site or app, they are met with a wall of text in a language that they do not understand. We at Reverie believe in language equality on the internet. It’s what drives us and gives what we do meaning. Language equality basically means that every Indian should enjoy the same range of options and experiences online in their own language that an English speaker does online.



We take immense pride in the fact that we tackle some of the most complex and impactful problems Indian language users currently face today. We’re working towards our mission of language equality by building a full-stack of language technologies and solutions, spanning fonts, font rendering, transliteration, translation, app & website localization in real-time, Indian language input (check out our Swalekh keypad on the App Store here), Indian language voice assistants, and Indic search, to empower the Indian language user and let them tap into the possibilities the internet offers them.



We are looking for an experienced data engineer to join our team. You will use various methods to transform raw data into useful data systems. For example, you’ll create algorithms and conduct statistical analysis. Overall, you’ll strive for efficiency by aligning data systems with business goals.

To succeed in this data engineering position, you should have strong analytical skills and the ability to combine data from different sources. Data engineer skills also include familiarity with several programming languages and knowledge of learning machine methods.

If you are detail-oriented, with excellent organizational skills and experience in this field, we’d like to hear from you."

India’s economic infrastructure needs a complete overhaul. Today our digital economy rides on rickety monolithic systems built in the mid-90s. It takes months to do a simple bank integration and launch a fintech product. This inefficiency cannot continue.

If our economy has to grow, we need killer API infrastructure for financial services that rivals the likes of Stripe, and AWS.

At Setu, we are fixing this for good, by abstracting away the complexity of working with legacy financial infrastructure and replacing it with a developer platform that offers clean, high-performance API bundles to embed finance into any application.

So that developers can do what they do best, build amazing products that improve people’s lives.





As a part of DevOps, you will be the bridge between product engineering and infrastructure. Designing operations, automating them and ensuring smooth delivery, SLAs and security compliance will be among your chief responsibilities to shoulder. Your work will help developers function in a deterministic environment and deliver products seamlessly, thereby improving the entire organization’s quality of output and shortening time to market.

In short, constant learning and quick implementation to build uniform platforms and processes, while inherently maintaining security and compliance in the systems.





The DevOps role involves owning the responsibility of creating, building and ensuring the smooth operation of our infrastructure. Broadly, this translates to the following roles—



In this role, you’ll be working with the bel ow tech—

We don’t expect you to be a know-it-all but as long as you’re solid on the basics and have the drive to learn, we’ll ensure that you’re provided with all the resources and the environment to learn and grow.

We have begun our journey by focusing on bus travel - making it easier for those that rely on it, and also for those that are choosing it. Buses, as a mode of transport, form the core architecture of any city's transport system.
